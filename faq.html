  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question"><span class="arrow">▶</span>Do I need a membership to join Girls Who Walk Preston?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        There is no membership or subscription required to attend any Girls Who Walk Preston walks or events!

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question"><span class="arrow">▶</span>How much does it cost to attend?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        All walks and events are free unless stated otherwise. For all walks, there is no cost to actually attend, 
        however there may be the opportunity to purchase a drink or some food before or after the walk. 
        This is completely optional. <br><br>

        For social events, the only time we will ask for payment is when we are required to pay externally for an 
        activity or venue. In these cases, we will always strive to get the best deal for our members. 
        Girls Who Walk Preston do not generate profit from any walks or events.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question"><span class="arrow">▶</span>Can I attend alone?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Of course! The majority of our members attend walks/events solo, 
        and everyone who attends is there for the same reason - to meet new people!
        <br><br>
        As we continue to grow as a group, we are still getting new members join every week 
        so we can guarantee that you will not be the only newbie!

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question"><span class="arrow">▶</span>I don't identify as a 'girl' - can I still attend?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        The aim of Girls Who Walk Preston is and always has been to create a safe, 
        welcoming and inclusive environment for women and non-binary people to connect with likeminded individuals. 
        We are trans inclusive and across our socials, use the tagline 'for the girls, gays and theys'.
        <br><br>
        If you think this fits your vibe then we would love to have you!
        <br><br>
        Please remember to be kind and considerate to others in attendance and reach out to Grace 
        if you have any concerns.
